-- what is a factorial calculation?

A factorial is simply multiplying a number
 by all the numbers below it down to 1. It's written as "n!"

For example:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Think of it like counting down from the number 
 and multiplying each step along the way. 

By mathematical definition, 0! equals 1 (this is just a special case).

-- why is 0 equal to 1 in factorial calculations? (0! = 1 in spec.js)

It makes combinatorial mathematics work properly 
(when calculating permutations and combinations)

It maintains consistency with the pattern that n! = n × (n-1)!
 there is exactly ONE way to arrange zero items (do nothing), 
  thus 0! = 1. 
  
If 0! were equal to 0.
 many mathematical formulas would break down if this weren't the case.
