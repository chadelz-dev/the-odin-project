    <div class="instructions">
      <h2>ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>As many chicken wings as you want</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Steps -->
      <h2>For Roasting</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat an oven to 200Â°C.</li>
        <li>Take chicken wings out of packaging.</li>
        <li>Place in an oven proof stainless steal dish.</li>
        <li>Place wings in the oven and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Once almost golden flip them and cook for another 15 to 20 minutes
          depending on how golden and cripsy you want them.
        </li>
        <li>
          When they reach your desired finish, remove from oven, give them a
          light salting if you want salt and allow them to rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy, if you eat dairy serve with sour cream.</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Steps -->
      <h2>For Grilling on a Fire</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Once your coals or gas flames are at your desired heat, remove chicken
          wings from their packaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place wings evenly on the grill and let them grill for 10 to 15
          minutes depending on how hot your heat source is.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once they've turned golden, flip them over and grill for another 10 to
          15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          When they reach your preferred golden crisp, remove from grill, give
          them a salting if you want salt and let them rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Server and enjoy, again if you eat dairy serve with sour cream.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3 class="highlighted_headings">Additional Notes on Cooking Times</h3>

    <div class="notes_para">
      <p>
        The only thing that will vary cooking times are your preferences and the
        heat at which you cook them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some days I like my chicken wings skin still soft and so I roast/grill
        them for less on each side.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the days I feel like my chicken wings skin a little more crispy I
        simply cook them a little longer, or at at higher temperature.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn't rocket science, it's chicken wings you can throw them on a
        skewer and suspend them over an open flame for long enough and have a
        lovely done wing, experiment and have fun.
