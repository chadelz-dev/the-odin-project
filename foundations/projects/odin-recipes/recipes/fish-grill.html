    </p>

    <!-- ingredients -->
    <div class="instructions">
      <h2>ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Any whole fish you want to cook</li>
        <li>Butter (raw and not processed if you can).</li>
        <li>
          Salt to taste though not necessary if you're using salted butter.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Steps -->
      <h2>For Roasting</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat an oven to 180Â°C</li>
        <li>
          Prepare your fish i.e: Scale, Gut and De-fin if you wish, your fish.
        </li>
        <li>Place in an oven proof stainless steel dish.</li>
        <li>
          Pop in the oven for anywhere from 30 to 50 minutes - see notes at the
          bottom of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the fish skin has crisped and turned golden, remove from the
          oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place as much butter as you want in an oven proof dish like a ramekin,
          allow it to melt but not burn. This won't take long.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pore half the butter oven the fish, then serve the fish and pore the
          remaining butter over the fish evenly and enjoy.
        </li>
        <li>Don't forget to salt if your butter was unsalted.</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Steps -->
      <h2>For Grilling on Fire</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare your fish i.e: Scale, Gut and De-fin if you wish, your fish.
        </li>
        <li>Place your fish into a fish grilling basket.</li>
        <li>Place over the fire and grill for 10-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Flip the basket once the first side has turned golden crispy and cook
          for another 10 to 20 minutes, see notes for time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the second side has turned golden crispy, remove from the fire
          and let it rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the fish rests, melt the butter in a ramekin over the fire, or
          in an oven - please don't use a microwave.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the fish, pore the butter over it and enjoy.</li>
        <li>
          Again, salt to taste if you want and/or if you used unsalted butter
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Additional notes -->
    <h3 class="highlighted_headings">Additional Notes on Cooking Times</h3>

    <div class="notes_para">
      <p>
        THe cooking time of your fish will vary depending on your size of fish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're grilling it on a fire or roasting it in the oven and the
        temperature you use.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've filleted your fish and only cooking fillets, well that will be
        almost instant and that should be done in a hot grill pan for best
        results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really big, thick and fat fish will take 50 minutes in the oven, whereas
        smaller more narrow fish will obviously cook in much less time - use
        your intuition here.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also cook it on the open exposed coal if you have nothing to
        cook it in or on, in this case, don't waste your time scaling the fish
        and just pop it on the fire, flip when you think you need to and remove.
        Peal the skin with the scales off and eat the fish off the bone. Very
        nice.
