1. Set Up Basics: If not done, create a Git repository 
    with basic HTML, CSS, and JS files.



2.done     Book Constructor: Make a Book constructor to create book objects 

    with properties like title, author, pages, read status, 
     and a unique ID using crypto.randomUUID().



3.done      Library Array: Create an array myLibrary to store all book objects.



4.done      Add Book Function: Write a separate function addBookToLibrary 
    that takes book details as arguments, 
    
     creates a new book object using the constructor, 
      and adds it to myLibrary.



5.done      Display Books: Write a function to loop through myLibrary 
    and show each book on the page (e.g., in a table or cards). 

     Manually add a few books to test it.



6. New Book Form: Add a “New Book” button that shows a form 
    (e.g., sidebar or <dialog> modal) for users to input book details. 

     Use event.preventDefault() to stop the form from submitting to a server, 
      and instead add the book to myLibrary.



7.done      Remove Book Button: Add a button to each book’s display 
    to delete it from myLibrary. 
    
     Link each DOM element to its book object using a data-attribute
      tied to the book’s unique ID.



8.done      Toggle Read Status: Add a button to each book’s display 
    to flip its read status. 
    
     Create a Book.prototype method 
      to toggle the read property of a book instance.


NB Notes: 

Keep book data (array) and display logic separate for flexibility.

No storage is required yet.


// exercise - create a book constructor
function BookConstructor(title, author, pages, bookRead) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.pages = pages;
  this.bookRead = bookRead;
  this.info = function () {
    return `${this.title} by ${this.author}, ${this.pages} pages, ${
      this.bookRead ? "read" : "not read yet"
    }`;
  };
}

const bookOne = new BookConstructor("The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 295, false);
console.log(bookOne.info()); // The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, 295 pages, not read yet
