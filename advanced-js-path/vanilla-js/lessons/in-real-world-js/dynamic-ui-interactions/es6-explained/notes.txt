-- key concepts

-- es6 definition:

 - es6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a version of js released in june 2015.

 - introducing features like let, const, arrow functions, classes and more.

   - this is for cleaner more efficient code.


-- ECMAScript release system:

 - post es6, TC39 shifted to annual release cycles (ES2016, ES2017, etc.)

 - using year based naming (E2015 = es6) with smaller feature updates.


-- browser support:

 - new JS features may not be supported in older browsers.

 - taking years for widespread adoption, which impacts real world applications.


-- babel:

 - a transpiler that converts modern JS (eg: ES6+) 

   - into code compatible with older browsers,

   - configurable for specific browser support needs.


-- real world relevance:

 - understanding es6 and browser compatibility is critical for:

   - building accessible web applications and,

   - preparing for junior dev roles where cross browser support is often discussed.

-- es6-features.js

-- What It Does: 

 - Creates two calculator objects (ES6 and ES5) 
 
 - and displays their add and subtract results in the UI.


-- How It Works: 

 - ES6 uses arrow functions (=>) and method shorthand for concise syntax.

 - ES5 uses traditional function expressions.

 - Results are rendered in the #output div using template literals.


-- Why It’s Written This Way:

 -  ES6 reduces boilerplate, improving readability. 
 
 - The namespace (ES6Features) prevents variable conflicts.


-- Real-World Relevance: 

 - Arrow functions are used in event handlers or React components for concise code. 
 
 - Interview tasks may involve refactoring ES5 to ES6.

-- release-system.js

-- What It Does: 

 - Fetches simulated user data, uses destructuring to extract properties, 
 
   - and displays them in the UI.


-- How It Works: 

 - Destructuring (ES6): Extracts name and age from an object in one line.

 - Async/await (ES2017): Simplifies promise handling for asynchronous data fetching.

 - The await pauses until the promise resolves, then updates the UI.


-- Why It’s Written This Way:

 -  Annual releases introduce targeted improvements 
 
 - (e.g., async/await for cleaner async code), making development more efficient.


-- Real-World Relevance:

 - Destructuring is used in API response handling 
 
   - (e.g., in Node.js or React). 
   
   - Async/await is standard for fetching data in web apps. 
   
 - Interview questions may ask for promise-to-async/await conversion.

-- browser-support.js

-- What It Does: 

 - Creates a product description string using ES6 template literals 
 
 - and ES5 concatenation, displaying both in the UI.


-- How It Works: 

 - Template literals (ES6): Use backticks and ${} for clean string interpolation.

 - Concatenation (ES5): Uses + operator, compatible with older browsers (e.g., IE11).

 - Both methods produce identical output but differ in syntax and readability.


-- Why It’s Written This Way:

 -  Template literals are more readable but require fallbacks for older browsers, 
 
 - highlighting compatibility challenges.


-- Real-World Relevance: 

 - E-commerce sites use string formatting for product displays. 
 
 - Interview tasks may involve ensuring code works in legacy browsers.

-- babel-example.js

-- What It Does: 

 - Renders a list of product cards using ES6 
 
 - and simulated ES5 (Babel-transpiled) code, 
 
 - showing both in the UI with a delay for clarity.


-- How It Works: 

 - ES6 Code: Uses const, map, and template literals to create product cards.

 - ES5 Code: Simulates Babel output with var and concatenation, 
 
   - compatible with older browsers.

 - The map method transforms the array, and join creates a single HTML string.


-- Why It’s Written This Way: 

 - Babel enables modern JavaScript while ensuring compatibility, 
 
 - critical for production apps.


-- Real-World Relevance: 

 - Babel is used in production for cross-browser support in e-commerce or SaaS apps. 
 
 - Interviews may ask about transpilation or supporting legacy browsers.
